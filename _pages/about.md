I am advised by [Justin Thaler](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/jthaler/) and [Alexander Golovnev](https://golovnev.org/) and part of a budding theory group at Georgetown.

I am interested in exploring the power of various classical and quantum models of computation. Currently, I am working on the following projects:
- circuit lower bounds for $$B_2$$ and $$ACC^0$$ circuits.
- relationships between various boolean function complexity measures
- algorithms and lower bounds for the AVOID problems which relate to finding explicit constructions for circuit lower bounds, rigid matrices, etc.

I am also fascinated by the literature on the quantum PCP conjecture and the field of quantum hamiltonian complexity more generally.

Recently, I have also been reading about the scope of  anonymization regulation in the [GDPR](https://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/recital-26-GDPR.htm). I hope to contribute to policy research that bridges the  mathematical and legal definitions of privacy as part of the [Bridging Privacy](https://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/bridging-privacy-definitions) working group.

Previously, I contributed to (and help setup) the [quantum information package](https://github.com/qutip/qutip-qip) of the popular quantum simulation toolbox [QuTiP](https://github.com/qutip/qutip). You can read about my implementation of quantum circuit simulation [here](https://sarsid.wordpress.com/2020/08/24/a-gsoc-summary/).
